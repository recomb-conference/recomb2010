   <!-- 	 <p>The date of the RECOMB-2010 conference was moved to <b>August 12-15<span class="super">th</span></b>.</p> -->
   <!-- 	 <p>Even though Lisbon airport remains open, many people will be facing significant difficulties -->
   <!-- 	 to travel here, because of connections in central Europe. Many more will probably -->

   <!-- 	 organize a successful RECOMB meeting are not in place.</p> -->
   <!-- 	 <p>The organizing committees have therefore decided that the RECOMB-2010 conference -->
   <!-- 	 will be rescheduled to the dates of August 12-15<span class="super">th</span>, in Lisbon. All the invited -->
   <!-- 	 speakers and panelists have agreed to the change, and we expect that all attendees -->
   <!-- 	 will be able to make the necessary changes in travel arrangements. -->
   <!-- 	 </p> -->
   <!-- 	 <p>Your registration fee will, off course, be valid to the changed venue. -->
   <!-- 	 The organizing committee will take all steps to minimize the inconvenience that -->
   <!-- 	 results from this change, including the re-booking of the hotels and other reservations -->
   <!-- 	 you may have made with us.  As you will understand, these are difficult times, and this -->
   <!-- 	 was a very difficult decision. -->
   <!-- 	 </p> -->
   <!-- 	 <p>All requests for cancellation of registration and rebooking or cancellation -->
