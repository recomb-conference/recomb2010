	    <p>As of today, connections with France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland and
	    other affected countries have been reestablished. Flights to and from the south of
	    Great Britain (including London) are still not operating,  Direct connections to other
	    continents and most of southern Europe are operating normally.</p>	    
	    <p>We expect that a progressive normalization of the situation will take place during
	    the next few days, and we hope that the large majority of the atendees will be able

	    <h4>Monday, April 19<span class="super">th</span>, 5:00PM</h4>
	    <p>All airports in Portugal and Spain are open, but connections to Europe remain sparse.
	    Flights from southernmost cities have been operating normally, but only a
	    few flights from central and northern Europe have operated. We are following
	    the ongoing discussion about the need for the ban on european air travel.
	    No decision to cancel or postpone the conference has yet been taken.</p>

	    <h4>Sunday, April 18<span class="super">th</span>, 9:00PM</h4>
	    <p>The European Union says that air traffic could return to 50% of its normal level Monday if
	    forecasts confirm that skies over half the continent are clearing of volcanic ash.</p>
	    
	    <p>A progressive return to normality is expected by many observers, as test flights from a number
	    of airlines have shown no damage to aircraft.</p>

	    <h4>Sunday, April 18<span class="super">th</span>, 11:00AM</h4>
	    <p>As of today, Sunday, April 18<span class="super">th</span>, the airport of Lisbon remains open and flights from
	    the Americas, Africa and Asia have been operating normally. From Europe, flights
	    have been operating only from southernmost cities (Madrid, Rome, Venice,
	    Istambul). Other airports in Portugal remain open and internal flights are operating
	    normally.</p>
	    
	    <p>We are following the situation caused by the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano
	    and will keep the information in this page up to date. No changes in schedule have
	    been decided yet by the organizing committees.</p>
