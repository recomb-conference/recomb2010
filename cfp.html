   <!-- 	 organize a successful RECOMB meeting are not in place.</p> -->
   <!-- 	 <p>The organizing committees have therefore decided that the RECOMB-2010 conference -->
   <!-- 	 will be rescheduled to the dates of August 12-15<span class="super">th</span>, in Lisbon. All the invited -->

   <!-- 	 </p> -->
   <!-- 	 <p>Your registration fee will, off course, be valid to the changed venue. -->
   <!-- 	 The organizing committee will take all steps to minimize the inconvenience that -->
   <!-- 	 results from this change, including the re-booking of the hotels and other reservations -->
   <!-- 	 you may have made with us.  As you will understand, these are difficult times, and this -->
   <!-- 	 was a very difficult decision. -->

	    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
	  <p>The 14<span class="super">th</span> International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB 2010) will be held in Lisbon,
	  Portugal, in the Business Center of Lisbon International Fair (FIL). RECOMB 2010 will be hosted by the Knowledge Discovery and Bioinformatics Group (KDBIO) of INESC-ID,
	  a research institute affiliated with Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, the Engineering School of the Technical University of Lisbon.</p>

	  <p>RECOMB 2010 will provide a general forum for disseminating the latest research in bioinformatics and computational biology.
	  As a multidisciplinary conference, it brings together academic and industrial scientists from molecular biology, medicine,
	  computer science, mathematics, and statistics. Papers reporting on original research (both theoretical and experimental) in
	  all areas of computational molecular biology are sought. Topics of interest include:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Molecular sequence analysis</li>
	    <li>Recognition of genes and regulatory elements</li>
	    <li>Molecular evolution</li>
	    <li>Gene expression</li>
	    <li>Biological networks</li>
	    <li>Sequencing and genotyping technologies</li>
	    <li>Genomics</li>
	    <li>Population genetics</li>
	    <li>Systems biology</li>
	    <li>Imaging</li>
	    <li>Computational proteomics</li>
	    <li>Molecular structural biology</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work.
	  The Program Committee will rigorously review submitted abstracts, and 30-40 will be accepted for presentation at the conference.
	  Accepted abstracts will be published as a proceedings volume in the
	  <i>Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics</i> (LNBI) series from Springer-Verlag, which will be available at the conference.</p>
	  <p>RECOMB is partnering with the <i>Journal of Computational Biology</i>. Selections of accepted papers will be invited for submission of full journal versions to special issues. These papers will also appear in the proceedings.</p>
	  <p>If you would like your papers to be considered for the <i>Journal of Computational Biology</i>, please make sure that they match the <a href="partnership.html">scope of the journal</a>.</p>

	  <p>RECOMB is adding a highlights track which will feature PI presentations of exciting developments that have already appeared in journals within the past year. This will be modeled after the successful ISMB highlights track.</p>

	  </ul>

	  <p><b>Manuscript preparation</b></p>
	  <p>A manuscript should start with a succinct statement of the problem, the results achieved, their significance, and a comparison with previous work. This material should be understandable to non-specialists. A technical exposition directed to the specialist should follow. The length, excluding cover page and bibliography, should not exceed 10 pages. The manuscript should be easy to read, using at least 11 point font size on U.S. standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper with no less than one inch margin all around. If the authors believe that more details are absolutely necessary to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix, which might be read at the discretion of the reviewers. An email address for the contact author should be included. Manuscripts that deviate significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
	  </p>

	  <p>For submissions published in the RECOMB proceedings volume, detailed formatting instructions are at the Springer-Verlag site, under "Information for LNCS Authors," at:
	  <br /><a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p><b>Paper submission procedures and notification</b></p>
	  <p>Submission of papers to RECOMB2010 will be through the EasyChair conference system, following the link from the conference web page.
	  The submission system will be open starting <b>September 2<span class="super">th</span>, 2009</b> and ending <b>October 5<span class="super">th</span>, 2009</b>. For full details, please see the submissions link at the conference website.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The Program Committee, chaired by Bonnie Berger (MIT), will referee the conference submissions.
	    Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by email on or before <b>December 8<span class="super">th</span>, 2009</b>. We request that an author of each accepted paper provides LaTeX files or an MS Word file in the special format for <i>Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics</i> by <b>February 7<span class="super">th</span>, 2010</b>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    An author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the paper; otherwise, alternative arrangements should be made to have the paper presented.
